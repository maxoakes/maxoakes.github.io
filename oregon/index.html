        <h1>Exploring Oregon</h1>
        <p>
            I love the idea of exploring the world. But since I cannot afford to travel internationally at this
            point in my life, I would settle for exploring the State of Oregon since it has such a diverse landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to plan and catalog my exploits but "exploring Oregon" was such a general idea. My overall idea was
            to go to every "town" in Oregon, but I had to narrow down what that meant. If I wanted to go to every 
            10-building hamlet in the state, the list of destinations would be close to 1000. I had to come up with some 
            criteria by which to separate places that I "have" to explore those that are optional. Eventually, I came up 
            with a the following list of types of places:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporated Cities</li>
            <li>Census Designated Places</li>
            <li>Communities with dedicated Zipcodes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Cities and CDPs cover much of the state and would make a solid list of places to visit. But there were some 
            smaller communities in more quiet and remote parts of the state that I wanted to see. If I were to simply 
            go to Wikipedia and grab a list of all "unincorporated communities" from each county's page, I would be 
            given a massive list of locations. Some of which include 10-home places like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwood,_Oregon">Ashwood</a>, which would be an appropriate target 
            place, and others include seemingly barren locations that have no trace of even the name of the community
            posted anywhere: an example being 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnybrook,_Oregon">Donnybrook</a> which is 10 miles away from
            Ashwood down a gravel road. I realized that many of these outlying rural areas usually need a zipcode. 
            Since there is a central service area for each code (usually named after the most populous town in the area), 
            this would present a reasonable criteria that would filter out the barren places. Following this rule, 
            instead of going to Ashwood, Donnybrook and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Heaven,_Oregon">Horse Heaven</a>, I could instead only go to 
            Ashwood, and save myself a 90 minute roundtrip on a hilly gravel road.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also wanted to visit the (accessible) ghost towns of Oregon. There are some that are very remote or on 
            private property that I would skip, but there are surely others that are reachable and would present a very 
            unique exploration experience. Ghost towns can be categorized into different groups per 
            <a href="https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~gtusa/history/classes.pdf">Ghost Town Classifications</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A: now barren location; may have some foundations of buildings at most</li>
            <li>B: Rubble and/or roofless buildings</li>
            <li>C: Completely abandoned place with standing structures that may still have roofs</li>
            <li>D: May still have a small population, but there are many abandoned buildings</li>
            <li>E: Many historic buildings, and the population is severely reduced from its boom years</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now that I have a list of places to visit, I need a way to track that I have actually been there. I eventually
            came up with a list of types of things to photograph as proof. Types of things include city halls,
            city welcome signs, post offices, municipal parks, or simply a photograph of the entire location if a place is
            small enough. With a list of places to visit and types of things to photograph, I was now ready to
            start exploring the state.
