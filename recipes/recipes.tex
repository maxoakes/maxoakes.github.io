\footnotetext[2]{The most commonly exported Italian olive oil comes from Tuscany. It is full-bodied with a slight pepper aftertaste. Ligurian oil has a sweeter and more delicate flavor and is ideal for this dish. Olive oil from the south of Italy has a faint almond-like flavor. It is worth buying the best-quality extra virgin olive oil for this classic Roman dish.}

\commentary{
    Crispy Soy Garlic Tofu. Crispy tofu pan fried in a garlicky, savoury, umami based sauce. This tofu dish is so good it may convert the people in your life to enjoy it! It’s fantastic for dinner, lunch or for meal prep. It can be vegan as well with a substitution.\footnotemark[1]\footnotemark[2]
}
\begin{ingredients}
    \ingredientsection{For tofu}
    \ingredient{350 grams}{extra firm tofu, cubed}
    \ingredient{3 tbsp}{avocado oil}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ cup}{cornstarch}
    \ingredient{1 stalk}{green onion finely sliced, optional garnish}
    \ingredient{1 tsp}{Sesame seeds optional garnish}
    \ingredientsection{For sauce}
    \ingredient{2 tbsp}{garlic minced}
    \ingredient{1 tbsp}{regular soy sauce}
    \ingredient{1 tbsp}{dark soy sauce}
    \ingredient{1 tbsp}{oyster sauce}
    \ingredient{1 tsp}{Shaoxing cooking wine}
    \ingredient{1 tsp}{white granulated sugar}
    \ingredient{1 tsp}{rice vinegar or white vinegar}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tbsp}{cornstarch}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ cup}{water}
    
\end{ingredients}
\begin{instructions}
    \item In a bowl combine sauce ingredients.
    \item Dice your tofu into 1 inch by 0.5-inch cubes.
    \item Place cornstarch on a plate and generously coat your tofu in the starch with gentle hands. Do this in a few batches. Once tofu is coated, set aside. Warning: Do not place tofu in a bowl and dump starch on top. This will make it difficult to coat tofu without breaking apart the tofu, even with your hands.
    \item In a hot non-stick pan set over medium heat, add oil followed by tofu. Allow the tofu to fry on top and bottom until golden and crispy (7--10 minutes per top and bottom, 14--20 mins in total). Note: 7 minutes for crispy or 10 minutes for extra crispy. Remove crispy tofu from pan and set aside.
    \item Into the hot pan, pour in sauce and let this bubble to thicken and reduce. Once thickened, mix in tofu until coated. Optional: garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Enjoy!

\commentary{
    This easy baked tofu comes out irresistibly crispy and seasoned to perfection! Use in stir fries, bowl meals, and more.\footnotemark[1]\footnotemark[2]
}
\begin{ingredients}
    \ingredient{1}{15-ounce block extra firm tofu}
    \ingredient{2 tbsp}{olive oil}
    \ingredient{2 tbsp}{soy sauce}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tsp}{garlic powder}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tsp}{liquid smoke}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tsp}{Sriracha (or other hot sauce)}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{4}$ tsp}{kosher salt}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{4}$ cup}{cornstarch}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{instructions}
    \item Preheat an oven to \temp{425}{F}. 
    \item Cut the tofu into 3/4-inch cubes (slice the tofu in half into two large rectangles, then into 6 long slices and across 5 times, for 60 pieces total; the exact size may vary based on brand). Place the cubes on a clean dish towel, then gently pat them with a second towel to remove excess moisture.
    \item In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, soy sauce, garlic powder, liquid smoke, Sriracha and salt. Add the tofu cubes and gently toss with a spatula until coated. 
    \item Place 2 tablespoons cornstarch on a plate and add 1 handful tofu cubes, tossing until coated. Place the cubes onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Continue with additional handfuls of tofu cubes until all are coated, adding the additional cornstarch as you go. This doesn't have to be perfect: just make sure the pieces are mostly lightly coated.
    \item Bake 30 to 35 minutes without stirring, until the tofu is golden brown and crispy on the outside. Allow to cool 3 to 5 minutes before eating. (Make it ahead or store leftovers for up to 3 days refrigerated. The texture becomes softer in the fridge and it becomes less salty over time. To crisp it up before serving, place it on a baking sheet, sprinkle with a few pinches of salt, and bake a \temp{350}{F} oven for 5 minutes until warmed through and crispy on the outside.)

    \item Combine all ingredients and gather into a ball. Now, divide into 15 smaller balls. Roll each balls thinly out with your Deep-Notched Linden Swedish Rolling Pin. If you do not have a notched rolling pin, then simply poke holes in your pieces of dough after you have rolled them out.\footnotemark[3]
    \item Prepare your bread board or counter to roll out the dough. Sprinkle flour on the surface. Roll each ball one at a time.
    \item Gently roll over each dough several times front and back to make sure it is thin enough and that it is perforated nicely. These perforation actually insure that the dough bakes completely through. Plus, since this is a cracker it helps achieve the desired crispness.
    \item Each hard tack ball of dough can be rolled in approximately 4''x 10'' pieces and then broken into smaller pieces when eaten.\footnotemark[4]
    \item Preheat oven to \temp{325}{F}. Bake on an ungreased baking sheet for 20 minutes on the first side, turn each hard tack piece over and continue to bake for 8 to 10 more minutes. Remove from baking and transfer to a wire cooling rack.
    \item When cool, you may store your Hard Tack in plastic bags, glass jars or vacuumed sealed jars for long term storage. Store on the counter or in the freezer.\footnotemark[5]

\commentary{
    A soft, chewy vegan gluten-free thumbprint cookie recipe made with almond flour and no refined sugar.\footnotemark[1]\footnotemark[2]
}
\begin{ingredients}
    \ingredient{2 cups}{almond flour}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{4}$ cup}{melted coconut oil}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{4}$ cups}{maple syrup}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{4}$ tsp}{salt}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{4}$ tsp}{baking powder}
    \ingredient{1 tsp}{vanilla extract}
    \ingredient{1 tsp}{almond extract}
    \ingredient{1 tsp}{apple cider vinegar}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{3}$ cup}{raspberry jam}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{instructions}
    \item Preheat the oven to \temp{350}{F}. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
    \item In a large mixing bowl, add all the ingredients: almond flour, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, baking powder, salt, apple cider vinegar, vanilla extract, and almond extract.
    \item Stir with a spoon to form the cookie dough batter. It should be sticky but easy to roll into a cookie ball, not wet or runny. If it is too wet, add more almond flour 1 tablespoon at a time.
    \item To make 32 small thumbprint cookies, scoop 1/2 tablespoon of cookie dough per cookie otherwise, to make 16 large cookies, scoop 1 tablespoon of dough per cookie.
    \item Roll the cookie dough in your hand to form a small cookie dough ball and place the ball on the prepared cookie sheet. Repeat to form 32 cookie balls, leaving a 1-inch (2cm) space between each cookie ball.
    \item For small cookies, place the back of a 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon in the center of the cookie dough ball. Press gently to form a hole in the center of the cookie, the sides of the cookie may crack slightly, and that's ok. If you made larger cookies, use your thumb to press down each cookie dough ball.
    \item Fill each thumbprint cookie up to the 3/4 of the hole --- not up to the top, or it may overflow in the oven.
    \item Bake for 12--14 minutes or until the sides of the cookies are slightly golden brown. They will be soft when you take them out of the oven, and that's fine.
    \item Cool 5 minutes on the cookie sheet, then slide a spatula under each cookie to transfer onto a cooling rack.
    \item If some jam evaporates or fades in color during the baking process, you can add a little more after they completely cool down.\footnotemark[3]

\begin{ingredients}

    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{4}$ cup}{granulated white sugar}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tsp}{pumpkin pie spice}
    \ingredientsection{For cookies}

    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tsp}{baking soda}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tsp}{baking powder}
    \ingredient{$\frac{1}{2}$ tsp}{salt}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{instructions}
    \item In a small bowl mix the granulated sugar and pumpkin pie spice together. Set aside.
    \item Preheat oven to \temp{350}{F} and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
    \item Spread the canned pumpkin on a plate and lightly press with a paper towel to absorb the excess liquid. Repeat the step at least four more times. The pumpkin should be dry enough that it goes from being $\frac{1}{2}$ cup dried down to just about a $\frac{1}{4}$ cup. Hardly any liquid should transfer onto a paper towel once it has been dried enough. Then set aside.
    \item In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
    \item In a large bowl cream the softened butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed for 1--2 minutes until light and fluffy.
    \item Add in the egg yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 1--2 minutes.
    \item Add in the pumpkin and mix on medium-low speed to combine.
    \item Add in the dry ingredients and mix on low speed just until combined.
    \item Scoop the dough with a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, and roll them into balls. Then roll the dough balls in the spiced sugar. (If the dough is too ``sticky'' chill it in the fridge for 10 minutes, then proceed.)
    \item Place the cookie dough balls at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. (I usually bake 6 at a time.)
    \item Bake the cookies for 12--14 minutes. (12 minutes for really chewy centers, 14 minutes for a slightly crispier cookie). When the cookies are done baking the centers will be puffy. As they cool the centers will fall and the cookie will get ``wrinkly''.
    \item Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to finish cooling. They are best enjoyed when they have cooled for at least 15 minutes!\footnotemark[2]

    \ingredient{1 cup}{roasted red-skinned salted peanuts or cocktail peanuts}
    \ingredient{}{Vegetable-oil cooking spray, for gloves}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{instructions}
    \item Preheat oven to \temp{225}{F}. Place popcorn in a large bowl. Melt butter in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar and corn syrup; cook, stirring occasionally, until thoroughly combined. Increase heat to high; bring to a boil without stirring. Cook until mixture registers \temp{245}{F} to \temp{248}{F}  on a candy thermometer, 2 to 4 minutes.
    \item Turn off heat; stir in molasses, salt, and baking soda to completely combine. Keep stirring until mixture turns very foamy and lightens in color and bubbles up quite a bit.
    \item Pour hot syrup over popcorn mixture and immediately sprinkle peanuts over top; stir until all kernels and nuts are coated. Let stand briefly. Meanwhile, put on a pair of rubber gloves and spray them with cooking spray (this isn't required, but it will help protect your hands from the heat, and it's important to work while the mixture is still warm).
    \item Working quickly, use your hands to form mixture into balls, each about 1 cup in volume (if you have a 1-cup scoop, use that!). Transfer balls to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once all have been formed, go back and use your hands to press them into tighter balls, so they really hold together. Let stand 15 minutes.
    \item Bake 45 minutes. (If one or two balls fall apart during baking, let cool briefly, then re-form.) Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 weeks.

    For anyone who grew up loving Cracker Jack, Crunch 'n Munch, or Fiddle Faddle, our caramel-coated peanut-popcorn balls are like edible time machines. A little baking soda in the caramel keeps it light and lacy, and baking the balls after forming helps set and dry them, so they end up crisp, not tacky. Wrap them in plain parchment and striped waxed paper for the full bonbon effect.\footnotemark[1]\footnotemark[2]
